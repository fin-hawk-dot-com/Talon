# Assets and Sprites Documentation

This document serves as the master index for visual assets required by the game.

The project uses a structured `assets/` directory to organize graphics. Specific requirements and file lists are maintained in `development.md` files within each subdirectory.

## Asset Directory Structure

*   `assets/avatars/`: Character sprites representing players on the world map.
    *   See [assets/avatars/development.md](assets/avatars/development.md) for detailed specifications.

*   `assets/ui/`: User Interface elements, including HUD frames and icons.
    *   See [assets/ui/development.md](assets/ui/development.md) for detailed specifications.

## General File Specifications
*   **Format:** PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is preferred for all sprites and UI elements to support transparency.
*   **Transparency:** Alpha channel required for non-rectangular assets.
