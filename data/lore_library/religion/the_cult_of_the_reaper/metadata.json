    "text": "The Cult of the Reaper is a nihilistic sect that views the System as a cage and Death as the only true freedom. They do not seek to destroy the world, but to 'liberate' souls from the cycle of violence and rebirth. They are outlawed in most major cities but operate openly in the lawless borderlands. Members often graft undead flesh onto their own bodies to grow closer to their deity.",
    "image_prompt": "Hooded figures in a dark cave performing a ritual before a statue of a skeletal figure, purple candles."
