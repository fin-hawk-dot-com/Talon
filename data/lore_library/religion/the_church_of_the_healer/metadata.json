    "text": "The Church of the Healer is the most widespread religion in the post-Awakening world. They worship the concept of 'Restoration'. They believe that the Awakening broke the world, and it is the duty of the faithful to mend it\u2014both physically and spiritually. Their clerics provide free healing to the poor, funded by the exorbitant fees they charge adventurers for resurrection services. They possess the monopoly on high-tier healing magic.",
