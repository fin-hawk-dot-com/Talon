    "text": "The Old Ways refers to the beliefs held before the Awakening and the System. Before the Awakening, there were the Primordials. Small pockets of rural folk still worship these ancient concepts\u2014Stasis, Silence, and Depth. They reject the use of System-based magic, claiming it is 'loud' and offensive to the true gods. These communities are often immune to scrying magic and live in 'dead zones' where the System interface flickers and fails.",
