    "text": "Air Essence is the power of freedom, movement, and the unseen. It is the lightest and fastest of the elements. Air magic grants the ability of flight, the manipulation of weather, and the creation of vacuums. Air Mages rely on speed and evasion rather than direct confrontation. They can strike from above with lightning or suffocate enemies by stealing the air from their lungs. Their personalities are often flighty and unpredictable, much like the winds they command.",
    "image_prompt": "A swirling vortex of white and grey wind, ethereal and transparent."
