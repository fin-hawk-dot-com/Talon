    "text": "Arcane Salt consists of crystals that form on skin and surfaces exposed to the spray of the Luminous Deep. They are highly conductive to mana and can cause mana burns if not washed off. Local dockworkers scrape them off hulls to sell as reagents. The salt is a key component in battery technology, making Orizon a strategic resource hub.",
