    "text": "Water Essence represents adaptability, fluidity, and the cycle of life. It is the essence of change and persistence. Water magic flows around obstacles, eroding defenses over time or crashing down with the weight of a tsunami. It is also the primary essence used in healing magic, as it can cleanse toxins and accelerate cell regeneration. Water Mages are often calm and observant, mirroring the nature of their element. They can breathe underwater, manipulate ice, and sense vibrations through liquid.",
