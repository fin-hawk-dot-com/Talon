    "text": "The Doctrine of Resonance is an esoteric branch of magic practiced in the Arcanum of Whispers. It posits that all things are connected by invisible threads of energy. By establishing a sympathetic link between two objects\u2014say, a wax doll and a person\u2014a mage can affect one by manipulating the other. This requires immense mental fortitude, known as 'Alar', to hold the belief of the link against the reality of separation. It is the basis for voodoo-like rituals and long-range communication, but misusing it can cause 'Sympathetic Backlash', cooking the caster's brain.",
