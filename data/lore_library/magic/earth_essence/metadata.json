    "text": "Earth Essence embodies stability, endurance, and physical substance. It is the most grounding of the essences. Earth mages can manipulate stone, soil, and metal, creating impregnable barriers or crushing enemies with the weight of a mountain. High-level Earth magic allows for the transmutation of minerals and the causing of localized earthquakes. Earth Mages are known for their patience and stubbornness. They are the builders and the defenders, often serving as the backbone of any party.",
