    "text": "Doom Essence is the sinister mirror of Hope. It feeds on despair, inevitability, and the concept of 'the end'. It is often used to curse enemies, inflicting bad luck, weakening their resolve, and accelerating the decay of their equipment. Doom magic feels heavy and oppressive, like the air before a storm. While often associated with evil, some 'Doom-Sayers' use it to predict catastrophes, arguing that acknowledging the end is necessary to prepare for it.",
    "image_prompt": "A dark grey cloud with red lightning, oppressive and heavy visual style."
