    "text": "The Art of Naming is the oldest and most dangerous form of magic. It is based on the belief that everything has a 'True Name' that defines its existence. If a mage can speak the True Name of fire, they command fire itself\u2014not by force, but by understanding. Mastery of a Name grants absolute control, but the human mind is rarely capable of holding such total understanding without breaking. A Namer can calm a storm with a whisper or shatter a wall with a word, but the effort can strip away their own identity.",
