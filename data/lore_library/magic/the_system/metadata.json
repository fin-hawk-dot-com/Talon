Some say it's a defense mechanism of the planet; others believe it's an alien construct designed to gamify our evolution. Regardless, it is the lens through which we now view the world. It provides the 'Status Screen', 'Inventory', and 'Skill Trees' that allow humanity to process the overwhelming complexity of magic without going insane.",
