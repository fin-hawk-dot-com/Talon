    "text": "In Orizon, Ascension is not just personal growth; it is a conscription. The city requires high-ranking souls to power its wards. The Spire Authority manages the 'uploading' of these souls, a process euphemistically called 'Ascension'. Families are compensated handsomely, but the process is irreversible, and the Ascended are never seen again.",
