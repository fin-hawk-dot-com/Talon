    "text": "Wax Essence embodies the duality of preservation and malleability. It can seal wounds, preserve artifacts, or trap enemies in rapidly hardening amber-like substances. Wax Mages often carry an internal heat, like a living candle, to keep their essence fluid. This magic is favored by archivists and those who wish to leave a lasting mark on the world.",
