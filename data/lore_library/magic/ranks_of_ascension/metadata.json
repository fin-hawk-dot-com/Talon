    "text": "The Ranks of Ascension represent the qualitative shifts in the density and quality of a mage's soul. The ranks are: Iron (the foundation), Bronze (hardening), Silver (refining), Gold (radiance), and Diamond (perfection). Each rank up is a major milestone that significantly increases mana capacity and lifespan. Reaching Diamond rank is considered the pinnacle of human achievement, granting near-immortality.",
    "image_prompt": "A stepped pyramid or ladder, each step glowing with a different intensity/color."
