    "text": "Time Essence is the most esoteric and dangerous of the known magics. It allows for the manipulation of causality\u2014slowing down enemies, accelerating an ally's speed, or aging an object to dust in seconds. True time travel is theoretically impossible, but Time Mages can 'step' through moments or rewind injuries. The cost of Time magic is the caster's own lifespan; borrowing time from the universe requires paying it back. Paradoxes are a constant threat, capable of erasing the mage from history.",
