    "text": "Essence Sickness is a volatile condition resulting from the body's rejection of incompatible or excessive magical energy. It often occurs when a mage attempts to absorb an Essence that directly opposes their natural affinity (e.g., a Fire mage absorbing pure Water Essence) or when they overindulge in mana potions. Symptoms range from fever and hallucinations to the physical mutation of limbs into elemental matter. In severe cases, the victim's soul unravels, turning them into a mindless Abomination. There is no cure, only stabilization through expensive alchemical purgatives.",
