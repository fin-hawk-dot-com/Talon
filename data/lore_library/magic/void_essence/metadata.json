    "text": "Void Essence is the power of non-existence. It is the antithesis of creation. Void magic does not destroy; it deletes. It removes matter and energy from reality, leaving nothing behind. Using Void magic is incredibly dangerous, as it erodes the caster's sanity and physical form. It is effective against almost all defenses but comes at a high cost. Void Mages are rare and often feared, as they are constantly at risk of being consumed by the very power they wield.",
    "image_prompt": "A black hole-like sphere absorbing light, purple rim, chaotic dark energy."
