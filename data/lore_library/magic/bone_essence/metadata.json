    "text": "Bone Essence is the foundation of physical structure in the animal kingdom. Mages who wield it can manipulate calcium and marrow, reinforcing their own skeletons to be harder than steel or shaping weapons from their own bodies. It is a gruesome but effective art, often associated with necromancers, though its use is not inherently evil. Masters of Bone Essence can even sense the skeletal structure of enemies, identifying weak points instantly.",
