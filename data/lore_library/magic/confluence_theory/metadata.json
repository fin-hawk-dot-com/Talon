    "text": "Confluence Theory is the advanced study of how different essences interact to form new, stable magical compounds. It posits that compatible essences (like Fire and Earth) amplify each other to create Magma, while opposing ones (Fire and Water) cause instability (Steam/Explosion). Mastering Confluence Theory is required to advance beyond the basic ranks of magic, as it allows for more efficient and powerful spellcasting.",
