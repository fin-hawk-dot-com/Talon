    "text": "Hope Essence is a unique, metaphysical energy generated by collective belief and positive emotion. It cannot be found in nature; it must be cultivated. Hope magic empowers allies, boosting their morale and stats, and weakens creatures of the Void, which recoil from its light. It shines brightest in the darkest hours, manifesting as a warm, golden radiance. Paladins and leaders often awaken this essence, using it to rally armies and turn the tide of impossible battles.",
    "image_prompt": "A warm, golden light radiating from a center point, inspiring and gentle."
