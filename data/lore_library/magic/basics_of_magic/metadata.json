    "text": "Magic in Aetheria is not a gift; it is a discipline of manipulating Essences, the fundamental building blocks of reality. Every mage begins their journey with an affinity for three Base Essences, which dictate their initial capabilities. Through training and meditation, these essences can be refined, expanded, and eventually combined into Confluences\u2014complex magical forms that blend the properties of their components. Casting a spell requires mana, a resource generated by the soul. Depleting one's mana entirely can lead to Mana Sickness or even death, as the body begins to consume its own life force to sustain the spell.",
