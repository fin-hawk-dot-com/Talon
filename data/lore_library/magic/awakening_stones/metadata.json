    "text": "Awakening Stones are rare, crystallized nodes of mana found in the bodies of high-ranking monsters or in areas of extreme magical density. When absorbed by an Awakened individual, they can unlock specific abilities or 'Skills' related to the stone's nature. For example, a stone from a Phase Spider might grant a Teleportation skill. They are the primary method for adventurers to gain new powers outside of natural training.",
