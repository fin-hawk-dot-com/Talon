    "text": "Fire Essence is the manifestation of combustion, passion, and rapid energy release. It is one of the most destructive forces in a mage's arsenal. Fire Mages are often characterized by their impulsive and intense personalities. Mastery of Fire allows for the creation of barriers of flame, projectiles of concentrated heat, and the ability to cauterize wounds. However, Fire is hungry; it consumes mana voraciously and can easily spiral out of control, harming the caster and their allies if not strictly disciplined.",
    "image_prompt": "A burning ball of fire essence, red and orange flames, dynamic and energetic."
