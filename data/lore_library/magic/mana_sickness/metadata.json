    "text": "Mana Sickness is a debilitating condition caused by completely draining one's mana reserves. The body, deprived of the energy it has grown accustomed to, goes into shock. Symptoms include blinding headaches, muscle spasms, and temporary inability to cast magic. Repeated instances of Mana Sickness can permanently damage the soul's ability to regenerate mana, effectively crippling a mage.",
