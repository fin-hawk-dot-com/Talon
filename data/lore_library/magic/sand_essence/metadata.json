    "text": "Sand Essence is often mistaken for a sub-type of Earth, but it is distinct in its fluidity. It embodies erosion, time, and the power of the many over the one. Sand Mages can strip flesh from bone with abrasive storms or bury entire cities under shifting dunes. It is a patient magic, one that wins through attrition. It has a strong synergy with Time Essence, as sand is the measure of the hourglass.",
    "image_prompt": "A flowing stream of golden sand floating in the air, forming shapes."
