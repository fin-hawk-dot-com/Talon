    "text": "Life Essence is the raw energy of existence, the spark that animates matter. It is distinct from Nature essence, which controls flora/fauna; Life controls vitality itself. It can regrow lost limbs, cure any disease, and even extend a lifespan. However, it cannot restore the dead. Overuse of Life magic can cause target organisms to grow uncontrollably, resulting in tumors or mutations. Life Mages are highly sought after but must be careful not to disrupt the natural balance.",
