    "text": "Death Essence is not inherently evil, but it is universally feared. It deals with entropy, the severance of the soul, and the transition to the afterlife. Death magic can be used to speak with spirits, drain the vitality of enemies, and animate the inanimate (Necromancy). Necromancy is strictly regulated. True Death Mages view themselves as caretakers of the cycle, ensuring that souls pass on correctly and that the undead are put to rest.",
