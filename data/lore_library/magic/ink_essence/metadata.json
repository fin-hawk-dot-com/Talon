    "text": "Ink Essence is an abstract power derived from the concept of communication and creation. It appears as a viscous, black liquid that defies gravity. Ink Mages, or 'Scribes', can bring drawings to life or rewrite the properties of objects by inscribing runes upon them. It is highly versatile but requires a sharp mind and steady hand; a misspelled rune can have disastrous consequences.",
