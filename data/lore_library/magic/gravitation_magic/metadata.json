    "text": "Gravitation is considered one of the Fundamental Essences, governing the attraction between all things. Mastery over Gravity allows a cultivator to increase the weight of their strikes, pin enemies to the ground, or even fly by negating the pull of the earth. It is a difficult path, often requiring the user to meditate on the movement of celestial bodies. Those who unlock the Gravity Essence often develop a stoic, grounded personality, unshakeable in the face of adversity.",
