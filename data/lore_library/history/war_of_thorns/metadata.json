    "text": "The War of Thorns was a brutal three-year conflict between the expanding industrial power of the Iron Vanguard and the nature-worshipping Druids' Circle. The Vanguard sought to log the Whispering Woods for fuel and materials; the Druids retaliated with plagues and animated forests. The war ended in a stalemate after the Druids threatened to unleash a 'Spore Bomb' that would have turned the entire region into a fungal wasteland. The resulting peace treaty established the current borders, which remain tense.",
