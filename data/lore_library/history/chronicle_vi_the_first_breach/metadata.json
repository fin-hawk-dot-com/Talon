    "text": "Chronicle VI: The First Breach recounts the immediate aftermath of the Fall. The Rift did not close. Through it poured the Void\u2014an anti-reality that sought to cancel out existence. Twisted geometric entities and shadows with teeth spilled into the ruins of Aetheria. The surviving ground-dwelling races (humans, dwarves, and the ancestors of the beastkin) were pushed to the brink of extinction. Magic became wild and unpredictable; a simple fire spell might summon a demon or turn the caster to ash. This was the darkest hour, where the very concept of 'Hope' was nearly forgotten, and the only law was survival of the fittest in a world gone mad.",
