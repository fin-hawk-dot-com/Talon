    "text": "The Rise of Ironhold chronicles how the scattered mountain clans were united under the banner of King Ironheart. Faced with invasions from goblin hordes and the harshness of the freezing winters, Ironheart convinced the clans to stop fighting each other and build a singular, impregnable fortress. The construction took three generations, carved into the mountain itself. It stands as a monument to unity and engineering.",
