    "text": "The War of the Shadow was a legendary conflict that took place at the end of the Second Age. The Dark Lord, seeking to cover Aetheria in eternal darkness, launched a massive invasion from his fortress in the Ashlands. An alliance of Men, the Ironhold Dwarves, and the Elven ancestors of the Whispering Woods united to stop him. The war ended on the slopes of the Black Mountain, where the Dark Lord was defeated, but not destroyed. His spirit is said to endure, bound to his lost ring, waiting for the day he can take physical form again.",
    "image_prompt": "A massive battle scene at the foot of a volcano, armies of light fighting shadow monsters, a giant armored figure falling."
