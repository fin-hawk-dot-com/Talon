    "text": "Before the current era, spanning ten millennia, the civilization of the Aethel reigned supreme. They were not merely magic users; they were architects of reality. The Aethel built floating cities of white marble and gold that defied gravity, powered by the Eternal Engines. They mastered Confluence magic to such a degree that they eradicated disease, hunger, and even aging to an extent. However, their hubris was their undoing. In their attempt to create the Omni-Essence\u2014a power to rival the creators\u2014they fractured the foundation of the world, leading to their swift and total annihilation. Today, their ruins are scattered across the globe, filled with advanced automata and magical traps that still function perfectly after thousands of years.",
