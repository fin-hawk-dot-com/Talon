    "text": "Founded over two centuries ago by Silas 'Iron-Grip' Hawksley, the clan rose to prominence during the Great Beast Migration, a period where monstrous fauna displaced from the south flooded the northern kingdoms. Silas, originally a common trapper with no magical lineage, earned his nobility by strangling a rampaging Bear-King that had terrorized the northern duchies for a decade. Since then, the Hawksleys have served as the realm's premier beast hunters. Unlike the Adventure Society, which takes contracts for coin, the Hawksleys choose their targets based on the threat level and the 'honor' of the hunt, refusing to slay beasts that are merely pests. They faced a near-extinction event fifty years ago during the 'Red Winter', losing half their number to a hydra that possessed regenerative capabilities beyond any known science, but have since rebuilt their strength under the current Patriarch, who instituted the use of alchemical suppressants.",
