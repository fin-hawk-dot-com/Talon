They theorized that if two essences could form a Confluence, then *all* essences combined would create the 'Omni-Essence'\u2014the power of creation itself. They constructed the Omega Spire, a massive focusing lens designed to draw mana from the planet's core and the sun simultaneously. They intended to overwrite the laws of physics, making themselves eternal gods of a new reality. They did not understand that some laws are load-bearing, and pulling them out would bring the roof down on everyone.",
