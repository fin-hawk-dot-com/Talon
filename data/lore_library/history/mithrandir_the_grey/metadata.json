    "text": "Mithrandir the Grey was a wandering Archmage of the Third Age, known for his grey cloak, pointed hat, and staff of white wood. Unlike the stationary scholars of the Arcane Assembly, he traveled constantly, inciting rebellion against tyranny and guiding heroes to their destiny. He was a master of Light and Fire magic, but primarily used his wisdom to solve problems. He was known for his magical fireworks and his friendship with the Great Eagles. He disappeared into the West after the War of the Shadow, his task completed.",
