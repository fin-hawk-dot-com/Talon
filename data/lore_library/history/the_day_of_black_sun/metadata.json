    "text": "The Day of Black Sun was a solar eclipse ten years ago that caused a global mana surge. Ten years ago, a solar eclipse coincided with a mana surge. For seven minutes, all Light magic ceased to function, while Dark and Void magic became uncontrollably potent. Thousands of low-ranked healers lost their connection to the light, while shadow mages inadvertently opened portals to the nether. It is remembered as a day of mourning, and many superstitious folk still hide indoors during any eclipse, fearing that this time, the sun might not come back.",
    "image_prompt": "A solar eclipse, black sun with purple corona, dark shadows stretching across the land, people cowering."
