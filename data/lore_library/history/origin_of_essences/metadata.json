    "text": "The Origin of Essences is a subject of fierce theological and academic debate. The prevailing theory suggests that Essences are the shards of a shattered creator deity\u2014the 'Primordial One'\u2014who broke apart to form the universe. Each Essence represents a facet of this deity's power: Fire their rage, Water their adaptability, Order their logic, etc. Mages are thus channeling the fragments of a dead god.",
