    "text": "The Pale Walkers are a group of seven ancient entities who are said to have erased their true names from the world's memory. They are harbingers of disaster, appearing only when the blue flame burns. Legend says they destroyed the ancient cities of the Aethel not with armies, but with silence. To speak their names is to invite their attention, so they are referred to only by euphemisms like 'The Seven' or 'The Chandrian'. They are the boogeymen of the magical world, feared even by the Archmages, and their motives remain a complete mystery.",
    "image_prompt": "Seven shadowy figures standing in blue fire, faces obscured, ominous atmosphere."
