    "text": "The Celestial Fall refers to the impact event that created the Sunken Ruins. A massive celestial body, likely a mana-rich asteroid, struck the earth, obliterating the city that stood there. The impact didn't just cause physical destruction; it released strange cosmic energies that mutated the local wildlife and warped the spatial dimensions of the crater. The crater eventually filled with water, creating the subterranean lake that now hides the ruins.",
    "image_prompt": "A meteor striking the earth, explosion, shockwave, night sky."
