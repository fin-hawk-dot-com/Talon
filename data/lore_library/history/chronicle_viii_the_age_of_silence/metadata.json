    "text": "Chronicle VIII: The Age of Silence describes the five-century period between the fall of the Aethel and the recent Awakening. With the Great Seal intact and the Titans dormant, magic faded from the world. It was a time of mundane struggle, where science and steel replaced sorcery. The Kingdom of Ironhold rose during this time, mining the petrified remains of the Titans. History became legend, and the horrors of the Void were forgotten, remembered only as fairy tales to frighten children. It was a time of peace, but also of stagnation.",
    "image_prompt": "Medieval city scene, knights in plate armor, no magic effects, grey and gritty realistic style."
