    "text": "Chronicle X: The First Wave covers the chaos of the first year post-Awakening, known as 'The Cull'. The first year after the Awakening is known simply as 'The Cull'. When the System integrated with the collective consciousness of humanity, chaos ensued. It wasn't just the monsters; it was the people. Suddenly, office workers could throw fireballs, and farmers could lift wagons. Governments collapsed within weeks as traditional hierarchies were upended by raw power. The initial mortality rate was forty percent. Cities became battlegrounds. It was in this anarchy that the first Warlords rose, hoarding Essences and enforcing their own brutal laws. The concept of 'levels' and 'stats' replaced currency. Humanity survived, but it lost its innocence forever.",
