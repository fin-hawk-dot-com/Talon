    "text": "Origins of the Iron Vanguard reveals that King Ironheart was not born a king, but a slave in the mines of the goblin warlords. After finding the 'Stone of the Unyielding' buried in a collapsed shaft, he led a revolt that shook the northern mountains. He forged his crown from the shackles he once wore, vowing that his people would never bow again. The Iron Vanguard was established to ensure that strength would always be used to protect the weak, a tenet that some say the modern leadership has forgotten in their pursuit of military industrialization.",
    "image_prompt": "A rugged warrior with a crown made of chains, holding a hammer, leading a rebellion in a mine."
