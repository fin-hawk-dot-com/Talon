    "text": "The year following the Sundering was known as the Ashen Year. Volcanic ash blotted out the sun, killing crops and freezing the rivers. Famine was rampant, and civilization nearly collapsed for a second time. It was during this time that the 'Essence of Life' was first discovered by a humble herbalist named Elara, who used it to grow food in the dark. She was later canonized as a saint by the common folk, though the Arcane Assembly dismisses her methods as 'wild magic'. Her legacy lives on in the agricultural rituals performed every winter solstice to ensure the sun returns.",
