    "text": "Chronicle V: The Fall details the cataclysmic end of the Aethel civilization. The ritual worked for exactly one second. The Omni-Essence was created, but it was too heavy for reality to bear. The resulting resonance didn't just explode; it shattered the dimensional barrier. The Omega Spire imploded, creating a tear in the fabric of the world\u2014a wound that would later be known as the Void Rift. The backlash caused the Floating Cities to fall from the sky, raining debris like meteors across the continent. The Aethel were instantly vaporized or twisted into the first Horrors, their souls fused with the very magic they sought to master. The civilization that had lasted ten thousand years ended in a single heartbeat, leaving behind only the 'Sky-Fall' ruins that adventurers plunder today.",
