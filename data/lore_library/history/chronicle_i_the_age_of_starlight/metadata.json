    "text": "Chronicle I: The Age of Starlight recounts the primordial epoch before the sun was ignited. The cosmos was a tapestry of infinite velvet, lit only by the distant, cold gaze of stars. In this era, the world of Aetheria was a dark, frozen rock. Yet, it was not empty. The Primordials\u2014ancient, formless consciousnesses\u2014drifted through the sub-surface oceans and deep caverns. They were not beings of biology, but of pure concept: Stasis, Entropy, Depth, and Silence. They shaped the mountains not with hands, but with slow, geologic thoughts. For eons, the world existed in a state of perfect, unchanging equilibrium. There was no life, no death, only existence. Modern Chronomancers believe that this era still exists deep within the planet's core, a pocket of frozen time where the laws of thermodynamics do not apply.",
    "image_prompt": "A dark, frozen planet under a starry sky, ethereal giant shapes moving beneath the ice, bioluminescent veins in the rock."
