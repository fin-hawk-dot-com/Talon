    "text": "Chronicle XII: The Treaty of Thorns recounts the peace agreement between the Iron Vanguard and the Druids. As the dust settled, territorial disputes threatened to start a civil war. The Druids' Circle, angered by the industrial expansion of the Iron Vanguard into the Whispering Woods, threatened to unleash a viral bloom that would consume the continent. Mediation was held in the neutral ground of the Sunken Ruins. The resulting 'Treaty of Thorns' established the current borders and Laws of Essence usage. It mandated that all Confluence-tier magic be registered and that nature preserves remain untouched. It is an uneasy peace, held together by the threat of mutual destruction.",
