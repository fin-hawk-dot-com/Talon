    "text": "Chronicle VII: The Titans' Sacrifice tells of how the dormant Primordials stirred. Though they despised the solar light, they despised the Void more\u2014for the Void was not Silence, but Erasure. They could not manifest fully, so they poured their remaining power into four avatars, the Elemental Titans: Ignis (Fire), Terra (Earth), Zephyr (Air), and Aqua (Water). These Titans marched upon the Rift. In a battle that reshaped the geography of the continent, creating the mountain ranges we know today, they forced the Void back. Unable to close the tear completely, they fused their physical forms together to create the Great Seal. They became the land itself, locking the Rift away behind layers of elemental stone and storm, entering an eternal slumber to hold the door shut.",
