    "text": "Chronicle III: The Rise of Aethel explains how the Aethel evolved to perceive magic strings. Millennia passed. Life evolved, and from the primitive races emerged the Aethel. They were the first to perceive the 'threads' of magic that the Primordials had left behind. Unlike the clumsy spellcasting of modern times, the Aethel wove magic as one weaves cloth. They built the Floating Cities of Arcanum to be closer to the stars and further from the primitive earth. They mastered individual Essences, then pairs, creating the first Confluences. Disease was eradicated. Hunger was a memory. They believed they had surpassed the limitations of the material world, referring to themselves as the 'Architects of Fate'.",
