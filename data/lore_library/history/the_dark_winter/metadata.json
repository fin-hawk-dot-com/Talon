    "text": "The Dark Winter was a year-long anomaly where volcanic ash from the Sundering blocked out the sun. Temperatures plummeted, and the Ice Essence in the north proliferated unchecked, expanding the Frozen Wastes to their current boundaries. Crops failed, and famine was widespread. It was during this time that the first Cryomancers appeared, adapting to the cold rather than fighting it.",
