    "text": "The Void Incursion was a historical catastrophe. Centuries ago, the fabric of reality tore open in the northern wastes, allowing the Void to bleed into our world. This event, known as the Void Incursion, brought with it aberrant monstrosities that defied natural laws. While the rift was eventually sealed by the combined efforts of the Archmages and the Guardian Order, pockets of unstable reality remain. Creatures like the Void Stalker are remnants of this dark time, phasing in and out of existence as they hunt for Essence to sustain their unnatural forms.",
