    "text": "The Creation War was an ancient conflict that predates the Aethel. It was fought between the Shapers, who sought to change the world to fit their desires, and the Knowers, who sought to understand the world as it was. The war broke the world, creating the Fae Realm and leaving behind ruins that still defy the laws of physics. It is the root of the division between Naming (Knowing) and Shaping (Changing) magic, a philosophical schism that persists to this day.",
