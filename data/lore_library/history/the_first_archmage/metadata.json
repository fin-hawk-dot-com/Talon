    "text": "Valerius the Wise is revered as the First Archmage of the modern era. In the chaos following the Awakening, he was the first to systematically study and categorize magic, rather than just using it instinctively. He developed the 'Three Pillars of Mediation' which allow humans to bind multiple essences without going mad. He founded the Arcane Assembly and established the first laws of magic usage. He disappeared fifty years ago, presumably ascending to a higher plane of existence.",
