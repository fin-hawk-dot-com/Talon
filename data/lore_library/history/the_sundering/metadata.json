    "text": "The Sundering was a cataclysmic geological event that occurred five hundred years ago, splitting the main continent of Pangaea into the current landmasses. While originally thought to be a natural disaster, modern scholars believe it was caused by a failed experiment to fuse the tectonic plates with Earth Essence. The event triggered a century of earthquakes and reshaped the flow of ley lines, permanently altering the magical geography of the world.",
