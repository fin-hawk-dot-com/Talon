    "text": "Mana Moths are small, harmless insects that are naturally attracted to high concentrations of magic. They are often used by adventurers as a primitive danger sense; if a swarm of Mana Moths suddenly disperses, a predator or a mana storm is likely approaching. Their wings are coated in a fine dust that is used in the creation of invisibility potions, making them a target for low-level poachers.",
    "image_prompt": "Swarm of small glowing moths, blue and purple wings, forest night background."
