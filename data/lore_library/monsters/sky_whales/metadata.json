    "text": "Sky Whales are colossal, peaceful beasts that drift through the upper atmosphere, feeding on cloud-mana. They are rarely seen from the ground, but airship travelers sometimes report hearing their mournful, resonant songs vibrating through the hull. Their bodies are buoyant due to naturally occurring anti-gravity organs, which are highly sought after by the Arcane Assembly for airship construction.",
    "image_prompt": "Giant whale with four wings flying in the clouds, tiny airship for scale, sunset."
