    "text": "Treant Shepherds, or 'Tree-Herders', are ancient, sentient plant-beings that inhabit the deepest groves of the Whispering Woods. Standing over thirty feet tall, they look like walking trees. They are the guardians of the forest, slow to anger but terrifying when roused. They view themselves as shepherds of the trees, protecting them from industrial expansion. They speak in a slow, rumbling language that can take hours to say 'hello'. In times of great war, they have been known to march on fortresses, tearing down stone walls like paper.",
    "image_prompt": "A giant tree with a face and limbs, walking through a forest, mossy and ancient."
