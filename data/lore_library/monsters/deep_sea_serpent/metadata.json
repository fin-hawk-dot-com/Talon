    "text": "Deep Sea Serpents are the apex predators of the open ocean. Growing up to a hundred meters long, their scales are harder than steel and capable of withstanding the immense pressure of the deep. They are solitary hunters, often mistaking submarines and whales for prey. Their breath weapon is a jet of super-pressurized water that can cut through hull plating like paper.",
