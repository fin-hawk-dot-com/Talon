    "text": "Iron Wolves are a mutated species of canine native to the metallic mountains of the north. Over generations of consuming ore-rich prey and water, their fur has incorporated trace metals, granting them a coat that acts as natural chainmail. Their claws are razor-sharp and can shear through standard leather armor. They hunt in coordinated packs, using complex flanking tactics. An Alpha Iron Wolf can grow to the size of a horse and is a formidable opponent even for a seasoned knight.",
