    "text": "The Skeletal Juggernaut is a colossal undead monstrosity created when hundreds of skeletons fuse together under high necromantic pressure. Standing over twenty feet tall, it wields weapons made from the femurs of giants. Its bone density is so high that it is immune to most non-blunt trauma. Defeating one requires shattering its central core, usually located deep within its ribcage.",
