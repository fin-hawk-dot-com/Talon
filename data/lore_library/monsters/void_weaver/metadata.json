Resembling giant arachnids composed of shifting shadows and purple light, they do not spin silk, but rather threads of concentrated Void essence. These webs do not just trap prey; they slowly erase them from existence. A Void Weaver can blink in and out of reality, making them incredibly difficult to target. Their fangs inject a venom that destabilizes the victim's mana, causing their own spells to backfire.",
