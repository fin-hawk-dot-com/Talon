    "text": "Unlike their rock or iron cousins, Obsidian Golems are not merely animated matter but are often created through volcanic rituals involving Fire and Earth Essences. Their bodies are made of razor-sharp volcanic glass, making them dangerous even to touch. They are typically found guarding ancient volcanic forges or the lairs of powerful fire-aligned entities. An Obsidian Golem's core is usually a piece of superheated magma that never cools, serving as its heart.",
    "image_prompt": "A golem made of shiny black obsidian with magma veins. Fantasy creature design."
