    "text": "Blood Devils are small, red-skinned demons that manifest from confluences of chaotic blood mana. They stand roughly three feet tall but possess strength disproportionate to their size. They are driven by a frenzy for fresh blood, which they can smell from miles away. When wounded, they do not flee; instead, they enter a berserker state, attacking faster and harder. They often swarm in groups of twenty or more, overwhelming larger prey through sheer numbers and ferocity.",
