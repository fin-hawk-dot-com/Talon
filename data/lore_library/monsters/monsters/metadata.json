    "text": "Monsters are not natural evolutionary distinct species, but rather corruptions of existing life forms caused by exposure to chaotic mana or the influence of the Void. They are ranked by the System similarly to Awakened individuals (Iron, Bronze, Silver, etc.), a classification based on their mana density and threat level. Monsters possess 'Cores'\u2014crystallized organs that store their magical power. These Cores are highly conducting and are the primary power source for modern magitech. Unlike animals, monsters are often driven by an unnatural aggression and a hunger for Essence, leading them to attack settlements and consume weaker magical beings.",
