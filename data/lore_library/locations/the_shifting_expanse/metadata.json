    "text": "The Shifting Expanse is a region of chaotic instability located in the western badlands. Here, the laws of physics are suggestions. The terrain reshapes itself daily: a mountain might be a lake by noon, and a forest by dusk. Gravity fluctuates, and weather fronts move backwards. It is the domain of Chaos Essence. Only the most adaptable adventurers dare to traverse it, as maps are useless. It is rumored that at the center lies the Eye of Chaos, a stable point of pure entropy.",
