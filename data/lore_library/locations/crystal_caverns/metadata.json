    "text": "Beneath the Crust lie the Crystal Caverns, a labyrinthine network of tunnels where giant, bioluminescent crystals grow like forests. These crystals are natural mana capacitors, amplifying any magic cast near them. This makes the caverns extremely dangerous, as a simple spark can trigger a chain reaction of explosive energy. The caverns are inhabited by crystalline life forms that feed on this energy. Mages often venture here to meditate, as the high mana density accelerates mana regeneration, though the risk of attracting Crystal Golems is ever-present.",

The air is cool and vibrates with a resonant frequency that can shatter glass. Adventurers flock here for the valuable essence-infused crystals, but many fall prey to the crystalline entities that detach from the walls to defend their glittering home.",
