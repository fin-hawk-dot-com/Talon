    "text": "Below Orizon churns the Luminous Deep, an ocean so rich in raw mana that the spray creates 'Arcane Salt'. The toxicity is lethal to the unwarded. It is the source of the city's power and its greatest threat. The deep glow of the water illuminates the underbelly of the city day and night. Monstrosities from the deep occasionally breach the surface, requiring the Sentinel's intervention.",
    "image_prompt": "Glowing neon blue ocean, turbulent waves, magical energy mist."
