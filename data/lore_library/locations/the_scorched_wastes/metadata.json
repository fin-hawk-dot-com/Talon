    "text": "The Scorched Wastes are a scar on the face of the world, a desert of black glass and ash. Legend says a duel between two Ascended Pyromancers incinerated the land centuries ago, burning away the very concept of moisture. The region is dotted with active volcanoes and fissures that spew liquid fire. Pockets of volatile Fire Essence spontaneously combust, creating firestorms that can strip flesh from bone in seconds. Only the hardiest creatures, like the Magma Crabs and Salamanders, survive here. It is a place of death, yet Fire Mages flock here to train in the intense heat.",

The ground is cracked, dry, and hot to the touch. Fissures spew magical fire that burns without fuel, and the wind carries the taste of ash and sulfur. Obsidian shards litter the landscape, remnants of glassed sand, and only creatures forged in fire can survive this desolate hellscape.",
