    "text": "The Sunken Ruins are the skeletal remains of a pre-Awakening metropolis that collapsed into a massive sinkhole during the Celestial Fall. Now submerged beneath a subterranean lake, the ruins are preserved in eerie silence. Aquatic beasts, mutated by the leaking mana from ancient reactors, patrol the flooded streets. Divers and water mages explore the depths, seeking lost technology and artifacts from the 'Golden Age' of humanity. The ruins still hum with residual power, and automated defense systems often activate when intruders approach the deeper vaults.",
