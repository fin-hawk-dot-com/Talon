    "text": "In the courtyard of the Citadel of Kings stands the White Tree, a symbol of the line of kings. It has not bloomed in centuries, standing as a withered skeleton of white wood. Legend says that when the true King returns to the throne, the tree will blossom again. It is a descendant of the Telperion, the Silver Tree of the Aethel. Its sap is said to have miraculous healing properties.",
