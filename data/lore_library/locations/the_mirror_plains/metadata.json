    "text": "The Mirror Plains are a vast expanse of flat, polished salt that reflects the sky perfectly. Located to the east of the Scorched Wastes, the ground is so smooth that travelers often lose their sense of direction, unable to tell the earth from the sky. It is a place of intense light during the day, blinding the unwary. At night, it reflects the stars, making one feel as if they are walking through space. It is home to crystalline life forms and is a favored training ground for Light and Illusion mages.",
