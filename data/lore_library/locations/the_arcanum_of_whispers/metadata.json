    "text": "The Arcanum of Whispers is located on a secluded island in the Azure Coast. This fortress-university is where the dangerous arts of Naming and Sympathy are taught. Unlike the Arcane Assembly, which focuses on raw elemental power, the Arcanum teaches the subtle manipulation of reality. Its masters are eccentric and dangerous, and its students often go mad trying to learn the names of the wind and stone. The acceptance rate is low, and the survival rate is lower, but those who graduate wield power that can bend the world without breaking it.",
    "image_prompt": "A massive stone university on a cliff, bridges, towers, mysterious atmosphere."
