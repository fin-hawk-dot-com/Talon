    "text": "The Azure Coast is a deceptive paradise. On the surface, it features pristine white sand beaches and crystal-clear turquoise waters. However, the deep waters just offshore harbor the greatest concentration of Water Essence in the world, drawing colossal sea monsters, Sirens, and Sea Serpents. The weather is unpredictable; calm skies can turn into a mana-storm in minutes. Coastal settlements are heavily fortified, often built on high cliffs to avoid the tsunamis that frequent the region. It is a land of high risk and high reward for maritime traders.",

Palm trees sway in the gentle breeze, and the ocean teems with colorful life. However, veterans know that the beauty is a lure. The tides are controlled by temperamental water spirits, and the deep trenches just offshore harbor leviathans that view the beachgoers not as tourists, but as a buffet.",
