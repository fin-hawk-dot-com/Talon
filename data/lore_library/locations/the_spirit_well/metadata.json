    "text": "The Spirit Well is a mystical cenote hidden deep within the Whispering Woods. The water is not water, but liquified Spirit Essence. It glows with a pale, ghostly light. Pilgrims come here to commune with their ancestors, as the veil between the living and the dead is thin. However, staying too long can cause one's soul to detach from their body, becoming a Spirit Guardian bound to the well forever.",
    "image_prompt": "A glowing blue pool in a forest clearing, ghostly figures rising from the water, peaceful but eerie."
