    "text": "The Sunless Trench is a chasm in the ocean floor so deep that light has never touched its bottom. It is the domain of Pressure Essence, where water weighs as much as mountains. Strange bioluminescent creatures thrive here, feeding on the thermal vents and mana geysers. It is rumored to be the resting place of a Leviathan from the First Age.",
    "image_prompt": "A deep underwater trench, bioluminescent plants, dark blue water, glowing vents."
