    "text": "The Archives of the Still is the central library of the Arcanum of Whispers. It is a massive, windowless building containing millions of books. Open flame is strictly forbidden inside, and the silence is enforced by magical wards. It is said to contain the 'Four-Plate Door', a sealed vault that holds the secrets of the Pale Walkers, though no one has ever opened it. The books here are not just read; they are listened to, as many contain captured echoes of the past.",
    "image_prompt": "Endless rows of bookshelves, stone interior, magical light orbs, a heavy stone door in the background."
