    "text": "The Library of Lost Words is a semi-mythical location that exists in a pocket dimension. It is said to contain every book that has ever been burned or lost to time. The air is filled with floating Ink Essence, and the silence is absolute. It is guarded by Ink Horrors and the ghost of the First Librarian. Adventurers seek it to find forbidden spells, but many become so engrossed in the reading that they forget to eat or sleep, eventually becoming part of the library's collection.",
    "image_prompt": "Endless rows of bookshelves spiraling into a void, floating black letters."
