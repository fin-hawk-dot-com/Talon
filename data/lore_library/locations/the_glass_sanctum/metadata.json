    "text": "The Glass Sanctum is a spherical meditation chamber suspended by gravity magic, three hundred feet above Orizon's plaza. It is a 'Null-State' environment designed for high-level cultivation. The floor is made of perfect Titan-glass, and the room is soundproofed against the city's eternal thrum. It was here that Commodore Elara was found dead, with no signs of entry or struggle.",
    "image_prompt": "A floating glass sphere in the sky, minimalist interior, meditation mat, view of the city below."
