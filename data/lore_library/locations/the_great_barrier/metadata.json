    "text": "The Great Barrier is a massive energy shield erected by the Iron Vanguard to contain the spread of the Void Rift. It consumes a tremendous amount of mana daily, requiring a constant supply of Essence crystals from the mines. Maintaining the Barrier is the primary drain on the Vanguard's resources, and any fluctuation in its power causes panic across the continent.",
