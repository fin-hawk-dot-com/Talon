    "text": "The Void Rift is a jagged tear in the fabric of reality, located in the deepest depression of the badlands. It appears as a fracture in the air, revealing a swirling, purple non-space beyond. It constantly leaks corrupting Void energy, which twists the landscape into impossible geometries. The Rift spawns horrors\u2014creatures that defy biology and physics\u2014that seek to consume existence. It is the primary frontline of the war for survival. A permanent garrison of the combined factions stands guard at the perimeter, holding back the endless tide of aberrations.",
