    "text": "The Whispering Woods is a forest of ancient, towering redwoods that have absorbed ambient mana for centuries. The trees have developed a collective semi-consciousness. Travelers report hearing voices\u2014whispers of their past mistakes, their fears, and their lost loves\u2014emanating from the bark itself. These whispers are a psychic defense mechanism designed to disorient intruders. The woods are rich in Wood and Life Essence, but harvesting them requires a strong will to resist the psychological assault. It is the sovereign territory of the Circle of Thorns.",

The Whispering Woods are named for the incessant, unintelligible murmurs that seem to emanate from the ancient oaks themselves. Travelers speak of hearing the voices of lost loved ones or the taunts of their worst fears. The deeper one goes, the louder the whispers become, until they drown out thought itself. Bioluminescent fungi light the path, but they also attract the forest's strange, shifting inhabitants.",
