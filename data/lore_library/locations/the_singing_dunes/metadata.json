    "text": "South of the Scorched Wastes lie the Singing Dunes, a vast desert of golden sand that hums a constant, low-frequency melody. This phenomenon is caused by the high concentration of Sound and Sand Essences. The dunes shift constantly, not by wind, but by the music of the earth. Travelers report hearing beautiful symphonies that lure them off the path, leading them into the waiting maws of Sandworms. At night, the sand glows with trapped starlight, creating a breathtaking, deadly landscape.",
