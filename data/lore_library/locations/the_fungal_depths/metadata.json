    "text": "Beneath the Whispering Woods lies a subterranean network known as the Fungal Depths. It is a bio-luminescent wonderland of giant mushrooms, phosphorescent moss, and deadly spores. The air is thick and humid, requiring filtration masks to breathe safely. The ecosystem here is aggressive; even the plants are predatory. It is the domain of the Spore Walkers and other decay-based entities. Alchemists brave the dangers to harvest rare molds found nowhere else.",
    "image_prompt": "Underground cave forest of giant glowing mushrooms, green and purple lighting."
