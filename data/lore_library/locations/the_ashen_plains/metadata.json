    "text": "The Ashen Plains are a vast, grey wasteland located downwind of the Black Mountain. Covered in a thick layer of volcanic ash, the landscape is monochromatic and deadly silent. Nothing grows here but twisted, blackened thorns. The air is filled with fine grit that clogs the lungs. It is home to Ash Mages and creatures that have adapted to the desolation, like the Ash Stalker.",
    "image_prompt": "A grey landscape covered in ash, dead trees, distant volcano, somber atmosphere."
