    "text": "The Black Mountain, also known as Mount Cinder, is a solitary, massive volcano located in the heart of the Ashlands. It is the only place in Aetheria hot enough to forge\u2014or destroy\u2014artifacts of the Sovereign tier. The air around it is poisonous, thick with sulfur and ash. It is a nexus of Fire and Void Essence. The mountain is said to be sentient, reacting to the presence of the Sovereign Band with eruptions and tremors. Deep within its Cracks of Doom, the Dark Lord forged his master weapon.",
    "image_prompt": "A tall, jagged volcano spewing red lava and black smoke, dark lightning in the sky."
