    "text": "To the far north, beyond the Razor Peaks, lies the Frozen Wastes, a desolate expanse of eternal ice and blinding snowstorms. The temperature here is so low that standard fire magic flickers and dies instantly. It is the domain of the Ice Essence in its purest, most hostile form. Massive glaciers shift and groan like living beasts, and beneath the ice, ancient things slumber. Crystal Golems patrol the tundra, and the wind itself seems to whisper in forgotten tongues. Despite the danger, miners flock here to harvest Perma-Ice, a material essential for cooling high-grade mana engines.",
