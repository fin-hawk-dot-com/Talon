    "text": "The Starforge is a mythical facility floating in the upper atmosphere, accessible only by flight or teleportation. Built by the Aethel to harness the power of direct sunlight and starlight, it is now an automated factory churning out Star Constructs. The machinery still hums with cosmic energy, and the view of the stars from its observation decks is said to drive lesser minds mad with the scale of the universe.",
    "image_prompt": "A floating metal station in the clouds, glowing with white light, stars visible in the day."
