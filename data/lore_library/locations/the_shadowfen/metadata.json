    "text": "The Shadowfen is a treacherous, sprawling swamp where the sun never fully penetrates the thick canopy of twisted cypress trees. The water is black and oily, thick with Decay Essence. The air hangs heavy with the scent of rot and old magic. It is a place where the veil between the material world and the Shadow Plane is thin. Spirits and undead often wander the mists. The fauna has adapted to be ambush predators, utilizing poison and stealth. Navigating the fen requires a guide, as the paths seem to shift when one isn't looking.",

The sun never fully penetrates the canopy, leaving the swamp in a grey gloom. The water is still and dark, hiding predators that strike without a ripple. Poisonous spores drift in the air, and the ground itself is treacherous, eager to swallow the boots of the unwary.",
