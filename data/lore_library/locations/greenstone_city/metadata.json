    "text": "Greenstone City is the beating heart of the Central Plains, a bustling metropolis built around the massive, glowing emerald monolith that predates the city by centuries. As a neutral ground designated by the Treaty of Greenstone, it is a melting pot of cultures and factions. The city is a hub of trade, where raw monster parts from the frontier are processed into goods for the civilized world. Its markets never close, lit by magitech lanterns. However, the city's rapid growth has led to a stark wealth disparity, with the glittering spires of the High District looking down upon the crime-ridden slums of the Undercity.",
