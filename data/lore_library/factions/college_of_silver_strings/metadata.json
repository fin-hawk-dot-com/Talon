    "text": "The College of Silver Strings is a guild of bards who have discovered that specific musical frequencies can resonate with the System. They use music to buff allies or sow confusion in enemies. They are headquartered in a magically acoustic amphitheater in the hills east of Greenstone. Their 'Spellsingers' can literally sing a man to death or heal wounds with a lullaby, making them powerful support units in any party.",
