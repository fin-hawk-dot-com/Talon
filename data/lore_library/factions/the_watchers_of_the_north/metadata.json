    "text": "The Watchers of the North are a secretive order of rangers who patrol the frozen borders of the civilized world. They are the descendants of a fallen kingdom, sworn to protect the realms of men from the horrors of the Frozen Wastes. They are master trackers, survivalists, and guerilla fighters. Grim and solitary, they are often mistrusted by the common folk, who do not realize that the Watchers are the only thing standing between them and the ancient evils of the North. They await the return of their true King, who wanders in exile.",
