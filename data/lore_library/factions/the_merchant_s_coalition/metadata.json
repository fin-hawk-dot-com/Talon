    "text": "The Merchant's Coalition is an alliance of the wealthiest trading families in Greenstone. They control the flow of Essence shards, monster parts, and foodstuffs. While they lack standing armies, their ability to freeze a city's economy gives them power rivaling kings. 'Gold talks, but Dram screams,' is their unofficial motto. They employ a vast network of spies and assassins to ensure favorable trade deals.",
