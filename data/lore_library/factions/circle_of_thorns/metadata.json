    "text": "Also known as the Circle of Thorns, this faction represents the militant arm of nature's guardians. They believe that civilization is a cancer and that the Awakening was the planet's immune response. Operating deep within the Whispering Woods, they wield powerful Nature and Poison essences to aggressively defend the wilds. They are not peaceful hermits; they are eco-terrorists who have destroyed logging camps and mining operations. They view the Iron Vanguard's industrialization as a declaration of war against the earth itself.",
