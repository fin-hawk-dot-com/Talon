    "text": "The Order of the Cleansing Flame is a radical sect that broke away from the Church of the Light. They believe that corruption (Void, Rot, and Undead) cannot be healed, only burned. They wield Fire and Light essences with fanatical zeal, often causing collateral damage in their pursuit of 'purity'. Their inquisitors wear red robes and silver masks, and they view any tolerance of dark magic as heresy. They are often at odds with the more moderate factions, who view them as dangerous zealots.",
