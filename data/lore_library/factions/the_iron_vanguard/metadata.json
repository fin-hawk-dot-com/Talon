    "text": "The Iron Vanguard is more than a military order; it is a martial philosophy made manifest. Headquartered in the impregnable fortress of Ironhold, they believe that physical discipline and steel are the only reliable defenses against the chaos of magic. Their knights wear armor forged from mana-dampening Star-Metal, allowing them to wade through spellfire unscathed. While they employ mages, they are strictly regulated and often serve in support roles. The Vanguard views the rampant, unregulated use of magic by 'adventurers' as a threat nearly as great as the monsters themselves, leading to frequent political friction.",
