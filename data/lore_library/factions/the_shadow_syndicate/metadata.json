    "text": "The Shadow Syndicate is an underground criminal network that effectively runs the black market of Aetheria. They deal in everything forbidden: unregistered artifacts, dangerous narcotics made from monster glands, and assassination contracts. Their influence is pervasive, reaching into the high councils of major cities. It is said that for the right price, the Syndicate can acquire anything\u2014even a human soul. Their leadership, known only as the 'Circle of Silhouettes', has never been identified, and their agents are bound by magical oaths that liquefy their organs if they attempt to betray the organization.",
