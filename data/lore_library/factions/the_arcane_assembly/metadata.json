    "text": "The Arcane Assembly is a loose confederation of the world's most powerful scholars, mages, and researchers. Operating from the gravity-defying Floating Spire, they seek to understand the underlying laws of the System and the nature of Essence. They are the primary source of new spell formulas and magical theory. However, their pursuit of knowledge often blinds them to ethical concerns. The Assembly is frequently accused of conducting dangerous experiments in the borderlands. They view the Iron Vanguard as luddites and the Shadow Syndicate as parasites, maintaining a haughty superiority over all who do not wield the Art.",
