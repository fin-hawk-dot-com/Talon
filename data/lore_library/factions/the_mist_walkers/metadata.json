    "text": "The Mist Walkers are a secretive guild of spies and scouts who operate in the Azure Coast and the damp marshlands. They specialize in Mist and Veil magic, allowing them to move unseen and unheard. They sell their services to the highest bidder, but they follow a strict code of neutrality. They are rumored to have a hidden sanctuary in the center of a perpetual fog bank at sea.",
