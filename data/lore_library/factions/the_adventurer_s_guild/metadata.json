    "text": "The Adventurer's Guild has evolved from a loose coalition of mercenaries into a global institution. They assign ranks (Iron to Diamond), distribute quests, and buy monster parts. They are the de facto law in the borderlands. Their motto, 'Ad Astra Per Aspera' (To the Stars Through Difficulties), reflects the belief that humanity's destiny lies in mastering the System. The Guild operates independently of any national government, a point of contention with the Iron Vanguard, but their monopoly on monster hunting makes them indispensable.",
    "image_prompt": "A busy guild hall, adventurers looking at a quest board, receptionists handling loot, fantasy tavern vibe."
