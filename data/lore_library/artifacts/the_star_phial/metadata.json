    "text": "The Star Phial is a crystal vessel containing the captured light of the Evening Star, Earendil. It shines with a pure, cold white light that is painful to creatures of the Shadow. It was gifted to a legendary hero by the Elf Queen of the Woods. It is said to be a light for when all other lights go out. The phial not only provides illumination but can also break illusions and repel high-ranking Void demons.",
