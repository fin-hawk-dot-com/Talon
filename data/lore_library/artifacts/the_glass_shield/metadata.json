    "text": "The Glass Shield is a legendary artifact said to be forged from a single piece of transparent diamond by the Titans. It is invisible until struck, at which point it flashes with blinding light. Its current location is unknown, though many claim to have seen it in the hands of a wandering mute knight. Legends say the shield cannot be broken by any force in this world, only by a weapon forged in the Void.",
