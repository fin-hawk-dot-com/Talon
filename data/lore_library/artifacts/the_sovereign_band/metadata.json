    "text": "The Sovereign Band is an ancient ring artifact forged in the fires of the Black Mountain. It was designed to harmonize all conflicting Essences, granting the wearer mastery over every element without the need for affinity. However, it contains a fragment of the Void Lord's will. It whispers to the wearer, promising absolute power in exchange for control. 'One Essence to rule them all,' the inscription reads in the Black Speech. It is said to have the power to dominate the minds of other Essence users, binding them to the wearer's will, but at the cost of the user's soul.",
