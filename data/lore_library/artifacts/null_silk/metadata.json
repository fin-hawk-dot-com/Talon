    "text": "Null-Silk is a rare fabric that dampens magical energy. Used by System Auditors and sensitive individuals to block out background mana radiation. It is expensive and difficult to weave, as magic cannot be used in its creation. It is harvested from the Null-Spiders found in the deepest, magic-dead zones of the Underdark.",
