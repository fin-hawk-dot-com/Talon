    "text": "The Seeing Stones, or Palantiri, are ancient spherical artifacts created by the Aethel. They allow the user to see across vast distances and communicate with other stones. However, many of the stones have been lost or captured by the Dark Lord. Using a Seeing Stone is dangerous, as one never knows who might be watching from the other side. Strong wills can dominate weaker ones through the link, driving the user to madness.",
