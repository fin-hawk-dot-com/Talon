    "text": "The clan is currently led by Lord Alaric Hawksley (Gold Rank), a stoic spear-master known for his absolute silence in the field. His wife, Lady Seraphina (Silver Rank), manages the clan's intelligence network. Their heir, Garrick (Bronze Rank), is often criticized for his lack of natural talent but is respected for his relentless work ethic. The true prodigy is the younger daughter, Elara (Bronze Rank), who awakened a Rare 'Sight' ability at age ten. The family's 'black sheep' is Vane Hawksley, Alaric's brother, who was exiled for using poisoned bait\u2014a violation of the clan's code that demands a 'clean kill' and respect for the natural order.",
