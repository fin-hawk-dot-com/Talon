    "text": "The governing body of Greenstone City is the Council of Six. Composed of representatives from the major guilds: The Adventurer's Guild, The Merchant's Coalition, The Arcane Assembly, The Iron Vanguard, The Church of the Healer, and a representative for the Common Folk. They meet in the Emerald Hall to decide on trade tariffs, defense budgets, and city laws. Debates are known to be heated, often requiring magical suppression fields to prevent 'accidental' duels between the militant Vanguard and the arrogant Assembly.",
