    "text": "Grand Archon Solus is the current leader of the Arcane Assembly. A mage of unknown age who specializes in Light and Time magic. Rumors say he is actually a construct projected from the Ancient Spire, as he has not been seen to eat or sleep in forty years. He advocates for the complete regulation of all magic usage and is the primary architect of the Assembly's restrictive policies on 'forbidden' essences.",
