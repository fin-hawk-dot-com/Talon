    "text": "High King Thorian is the ruler of Ironhold. A giant of a man, even by mountain standards. He wields the hammer 'Earth-Shaker', a weapon so heavy that no other man can lift it. He despises politics and prefers to solve disputes through trial by combat. Under his rule, Ironhold has become isolationist but impregnable, turning the mountain into a self-sustaining fortress city.",
