    "text": "Cassian Thorne is a Silver-Rank System Auditor. Cassian finds 'magic' exhausting. To him, a fireball is a thermal hazard requiring three forms of paperwork. He wears a coat lined with Null-Silk to dampen the city\u2019s background mana noise because he suffers from 'Aura Migraines'. He investigates System Errors with the weary precision of a janitor for the laws of physics, often uncovering corruption within the Spire Authority.",
