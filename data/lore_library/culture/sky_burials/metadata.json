    "text": "In the mountainous regions controlled by the Iron Vanguard, the dead are not buried. They are taken to high peaks and left for the griffins and giant eagles. This practice, known as Sky Burial, is based on the belief that by feeding the beasts of the sky, the soul is carried upward to the Aethel's ancient domain. To be buried in the ground is considered a curse, trapping the soul in the dark earth forever.",
    "image_prompt": "A high mountain peak with a stone altar, birds circling overhead, solemn ceremony."
