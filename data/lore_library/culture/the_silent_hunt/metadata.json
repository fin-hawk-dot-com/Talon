    "text": "The Silent Hunt is the most sacred tradition of Clan Hawksley. To reach adulthood, a clan member must track and kill a beast of at least Bronze rank without using any offensive Essence abilities\u2014relying solely on physical skill, traps, and their bonded hunting hound. This rite ensures that a Hawksley never becomes over-reliant on magic. Those who fail are not exiled but are relegated to support roles within the estate, a shame that drives many to attempt the trial multiple times until they either succeed or die in the attempt.",
