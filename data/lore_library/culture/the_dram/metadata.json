    "text": "The Dram is the universal currency of Aetheria. A 'Dram' is a standardized weight of crystallized mana. Unlike gold, which has no intrinsic value, a Dram can be consumed to restore a small amount of mana, making it a commodity with practical use. Inflation is controlled by the simple fact that people literally eat their money when times are tough or when in desperate need of mana during combat.",
    "image_prompt": "A pile of glowing blue crystal coins or small bars, stamped with magical runes."
