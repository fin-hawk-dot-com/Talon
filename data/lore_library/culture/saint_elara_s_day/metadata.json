    "text": "Saint Elara's Day is a holiday celebrating the saint who discovered Life Essence. On this day, all healing services are free, and citizens plant trees and flowers in the streets. It is considered bad luck to spill blood on Saint Elara's Day, so even the Adventurer's Guild pauses its monster-hunting contracts. It is the one day of the year where the world feels truly at peace.",
    "image_prompt": "City streets filled with flowers, people planting saplings, festive and peaceful atmosphere."
