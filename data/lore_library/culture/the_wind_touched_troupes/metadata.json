    "text": "The Wind-Touched Troupes are nomadic performers who travel the roads of Aetheria in colorful wagons. While often mistrusted by villagers as thieves, they are actually the keepers of the world's oral history. They believe that a story is not true unless it is told, and they possess songs that can calm storms or incite riots. To be a guest at their campfire is a rare honor, often rewarded with tales of the Old World. They are immune to the 'despair' effects of the Void, leading some to believe they are protected by an ancient god.",
