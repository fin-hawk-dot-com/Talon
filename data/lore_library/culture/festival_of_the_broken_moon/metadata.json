    "text": "Held annually to mark the anniversary of the Awakening, the Festival of the Broken Moon is a solemn yet beautiful event. Citizens light floating lanterns to guide the souls lost during the chaos. It is a time of reflection, but also of celebration, symbolizing that even a broken world can shine. The climax of the festival involves the Archmages casting a massive illusion spell to restore the moon's shattered appearance for a single night.",
    "image_prompt": "Night city scene, thousands of floating paper lanterns, crowd looking up, emotional atmosphere."
