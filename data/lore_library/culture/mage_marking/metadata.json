    "text": "Mage-Marking is a social custom where mages tattoo their rank and affinity onto their skin using ink mixed with Essence. These marks glow when the mage casts a spell. While not legally required, an unmarked mage is often viewed with suspicion, as it implies they have something to hide\u2014or are an unregistered hedge wizard. High-ranking mages often have elaborate, full-body tattoos that act as auxiliary spell circuits.",
