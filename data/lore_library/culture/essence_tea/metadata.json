    "text": "Essence Tea is a popular beverage among the upper class of Greenstone City. Brewed from the leaves of the Mana-fern, it glows faintly in the cup. It is said to restore mental clarity and slightly replenish mana reserves, though drinking too much can cause 'the jitters', a state of hyper-awareness where one hears colors. The finest blends are imported from the Whispering Woods, often smuggled past Druid patrols who view the commercialization of the forest as sacrilege.",
    "image_prompt": "A porcelain teacup with glowing blue liquid, steam forming magical shapes, elegant setting."
