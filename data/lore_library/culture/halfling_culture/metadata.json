    "text": "The 'Small Folk' or Halflings of the Green Valleys are a peaceful, agrarian culture known for their love of food, ale, and pipe-weed. They are remarkably resistant to the corruption of Void Essence, perhaps due to their lack of ambition for power. Their culture revolves around comfort and community. They famously eat seven meals a day: Breakfast, Second Breakfast, Elevenses, Luncheon, Afternoon Tea, Dinner, and Supper. Adventurers often find Halfling villages to be the best places to rest and recover morale.",
    "image_prompt": "A cozy hobbit-hole interior, round door, table full of food, happy small people eating."
