It began with the Starfall, a meteor shower not of rock, but of crystallized mana that bombarded the planet for three days and nights. The influx of high-density cosmic mana overwhelmed the degrading Seal, shattering it. Magic returned to Aetheria, but it was not the gentle flow of the First Age; it was a violent deluge. Animals warped into monsters within hours, their biology rewritten by chaotic energy. Humans, too, were affected; those with latent potential 'Awakened', their souls adapting to the mana density by manifesting the System\u2014a quantified interface to manage their new power. The Rift, a tear in reality, pulsed open, and secondary tears appeared globally. We are now in the Second Age of Magic, an era of danger and limitless potential, where Adventurers rise to master forces that once destroyed civilizations.",
