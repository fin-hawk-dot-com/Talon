# Game Mechanics

## Ranks
The progression system is divided into 5 major ranks:
1. **Iron**: The starting rank.
2. **Bronze**: Enhanced physical and magical capabilities.
3. **Silver**: Superhuman level.
4. **Gold**: Demigod level.
5. **Diamond**: Apex of power.

## Attributes
Characters have 4 main attributes:
- **Power**: Physical strength and damage.
- **Speed**: Movement and reaction time.
- **Spirit**: Magical power and mana pool.
- **Recovery**: Health regeneration and stamina.

### Attribute Growth
- Attributes have a numerical value.
- **Iron Rank**: 0 - 99
- **Bronze Rank**: 100 - 199
- **Silver Rank**: 200 - 299
- ... and so on.

Attributes grow by training. The rate of growth is determined by the **Growth Multiplier**, which is influenced by how many Essences are bonded to that attribute.
- 0 Bonds: 1.0x (Slow)
- 1 Bond: 1.2x
- 2 Bonds: 1.5x
- 3 Bonds: 2.0x
- 4 Bonds: 3.0x (Fastest)

## Essences & Abilities
A character has 3 Base Essences and 1 Confluence Essence (derived from the combination of the 3 bases).
Each Essence has 5 Ability Slots, for a total of 20 Abilities.

### Awakening
Abilities are unlocked ("Awakened") by using **Awakening Stones**.
- The type of Stone determines the function of the ability (e.g., Attack, Defense, Summon).
- The Essence determines the flavor and element.

### Ability Progression
- **Level**: Each ability starts at Level 0 and goes up to Level 9.
- **XP**: Using an ability grants XP. When XP fills the bar, the ability levels up.
- **Rank Up**: When an ability reaches Level 9 and the XP bar is full, it is ready to Rank Up (e.g., Iron 9 -> Bronze 0).
- **Limitation**: An ability cannot be a higher rank than the Character's rank (determined by their lowest attribute).

## Character Rank
A Character's overall rank is determined by their **lowest** attribute.
- To reach Bronze Rank, all 4 attributes must be at least 100.
- Once the body (attributes) ranks up, abilities can then be ranked up to match.
