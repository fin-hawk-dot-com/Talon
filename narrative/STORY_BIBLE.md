# Aetheria: Story Bible

## 1. World Overview
**Premise**:
We are in the **Second Age of Magic**, thirty years after "The Awakening". The world of Aetheria has been transformed by the shattering of the Great Seal, which released a deluge of cosmic mana and tore open the "Void Rift". This event rewrote the laws of physics, turning animals into monsters and granting humans the ability to wield "Essences" via a quantified interface known as "The System".

**The System**:
An interface that overlays reality for all Awakened individuals. It quantifies abstract concepts like soul strength into numbers, providing "Status Screens", "Inventories", and "Skill Trees". It acts as a mental buffer, allowing humanity to process the overwhelming complexity of magic without descending into madness. Scholars debate its origin—some claim it is a planetary defense mechanism, others an alien construct.

*Deep Lore Note*: While most view the System as a gift, ancient texts suggest it is a "Cosmic Shackle." By quantifying magic into levels and cooldowns, it limits the infinite potential of the soul to prevent another "Great Hubris." It is a cage that keeps humanity safe, but also weak.

## 2. History & Timeline

### The First Age (The Age of Starlight)
*   **Chronicle I**: The world was dark and frozen, inhabited by formless Primordials (Stasis, Entropy, Depth, Silence).
*   **Chronicle II**: The Solar Spark ignited the sun, banishing the Primordials to the deep core and birthing biological life.

### The Aethel Civilization
*   **Chronicle III**: The Aethel rose, perceiving magic threads and building floating cities. They mastered Confluence magic.
*   **Chronicle IV (The Great Hubris)**: The Aethel attempted to create the "Omni-Essence" to become gods. The experiment failed, shattering dimensional barriers and creating the Void Rift.
*   **Chronicle V (The Fall)**: The Aethel civilization was vaporized or twisted into horrors. Their cities fell from the sky ("Sky-Fall").
*   **Chronicle VI (The First Breach)**: The Void poured through the Rift. Twisted geometric entities spilled into the ruins.

### The Age of Silence
*   **Chronicle VII**: The Elemental Titans (Ignis, Terra, Zephyr, Aqua) sacrificed themselves to form the "Great Seal", locking away the Rift.
*   **Chronicle VIII**: Magic faded. Science and steel ruled. The Kingdom of Ironhold was founded.
*   **The Sundering**: 500 years ago, a cataclysmic event split the main continent.
