# Aetheria: Story Bible

## 1. World Overview
**Premise**:
We are in the **Second Age of Magic**, thirty years after "The Awakening". The world of Aetheria has been transformed by the shattering of the Great Seal, which released a deluge of cosmic mana and tore open the "Void Rift". This event rewrote the laws of physics, turning animals into monsters and granting humans the ability to wield "Essences" via a quantified interface known as "The System".

**The System**:
An interface that overlays reality for all Awakened individuals. It quantifies abstract concepts like soul strength into numbers, providing "Status Screens", "Inventories", and "Skill Trees". It acts as a mental buffer, allowing humanity to process the overwhelming complexity of magic without descending into madness.

## 2. History & Timeline

### The First Age (The Age of Starlight)
*   **Chronicle I**: The world was dark and frozen, inhabited by formless Primordials (Stasis, Entropy, Depth, Silence).
*   **Chronicle II**: The Solar Spark ignited the sun, banishing the Primordials to the deep core and birthing biological life.

### The Aethel Civilization
*   **Chronicle III**: The Aethel rose, perceiving magic threads and building floating cities. They mastered Confluence magic.
*   **Chronicle IV (The Great Hubris)**: The Aethel attempted to create the "Omni-Essence" to become gods. The experiment failed, shattering dimensional barriers and creating the Void Rift.
*   **Chronicle V (The Fall)**: The Aethel civilization was vaporized or twisted into horrors. Their cities fell from the sky ("Sky-Fall").

### The Age of Silence
*   **Chronicle VII**: The Elemental Titans (Ignis, Terra, Zephyr, Aqua) sacrificed themselves to form the "Great Seal", locking away the Rift.
*   **Chronicle VIII**: Magic faded. Science and steel ruled. The Kingdom of Ironhold was founded.

### The Awakening (30 Years Ago)
*   **Chronicle IX**: The Great Seal shattered under a meteor shower of crystallized mana ("Starfall"). Magic returned violently. The System manifested.
*   **Chronicle X (The Cull)**: Chaos ensued. 40% of the population died in the first year. Warlords rose.
*   **Chronicle XI**: The Siege of Greenstone. First major Horde Event (Plague Lord Malakor). Factions united to defend the city.
*   **Chronicle XII**: Treaty of Thorns. Peace established between Iron Vanguard and Druids' Circle.
*   **Chronicle XIII (Current Era)**: Society has rebuilt around the System. Greenstone City is a neutral hub. The Void Rift is pulsing again.

## 5. Magic System

**Concept**: Magic is the manipulation of **Essences**, shards of a shattered creator deity.

*   **Time**: Causality manipulation (Dangerous).
*   **Space/Gravity**: Movement, weight.

### Confluences
Combining essences creates new forms:
*   Fire + Earth = Magma
